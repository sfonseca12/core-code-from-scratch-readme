### 1. Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages

| Interpreted Programming Languages | Compliled Programming Languages |
| --- | --- |
| The source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code. | Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. |
| Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of just-in-time compilation, that gap is shrinking. | They tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. |
| Interpreted languages tend to be more flexible, and often offer features like dynamic typing and smaller program size. | They give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage. |
| Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. | You need to “rebuild” the program every time you need to make a change. |
| Examples of common interpreted languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript. | Examples of pure compiled languages are C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, and Go. |
| Because interpreters execute the source program code themselves, the code itself is platform independent. | Platform dependence of the generated binary code. |
| Source code is public. | Source code is private. |
| Interpreted languages requires an interpreter. | Compiled languages need a “build” step – they need to be manually compiled first. |

Most programming languages can have both compiled and interpreted implementations – the language itself is not necessarily compiled or interpreted. However, for simplicity’s sake, they’re typically referred to as such.

Python, for example, can be executed as either a compiled program or as an interpreted language in interactive mode. On the other hand, most command line tools, CLIs, and shells can theoretically be classified as interpreted languages.

### 2. Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?
