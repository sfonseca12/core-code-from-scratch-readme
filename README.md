## 1.Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages

|Programing Languages|

|**Interpreted**|**Compiled**|

Compiled Programming Languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than interpreted languages. They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage.Compiled languages need a “build” step – they need to be manually compiled first. You need to “rebuild” the program every time you need to make a change.
Examples of pure compiled languages are C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, and Go.
The most notable disadvantages of compiled Languages are:
*Additional time needed to complete the entire compilation step before testing
*Platform dependence of the generated binary code

Interpreted Programming Languages run through a program line by line and execute each command.Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. But, with the development of just-in-time compilation, that gap is shrinking.
Examples of common interpreted languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript

Interpreted languages tend to be more flexible, and often offer features like dynamic typing and smaller program size. Also, because interpreters execute the source program code themselves, the code itself is platform independent.
